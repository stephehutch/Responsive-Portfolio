          In 2009 the infant mortality rate in the Fifth Section was 50%. The Fifth Section St. Marc, Haiti that is
          largely ignored by the government. The people there are a welcoming tight-knit community who never hesitate
          to smile and say hello to any stranger they pass on the street. I remember walking from mud house to mud
          house inviting people to a free clinic down the street. During my walk, I met a woman with an infant clinging
          to her breast. The child did not look like an invalid except for his curly red hair. His hair should have
          been black, but malnutrition had changed it to a vibrant shade of orange. With a 50% infant mortality rate I
          knew that this child’s chances of seeing his second birthday were slim to none. I felt hopeless because there
          was absolutely nothing I could do to help this child.

            I try to adhere to philosophy that a business can have more purposes than simply the accumulation of
            wealth. I would be a good addition to the program because I can offer a fresh perspective due to direct
            experience with people in underdeveloped countries. I have seen firsthand what a community looks like with
            a total lack of commerce. A business can build a community from the ground up. I couldn’t do anything to
            help that baby, but with an advanced degree, I could learn more about how a functioning economy works from
            the perspectives of three different developed economies.

          <p> While studying abroad at Germany’s WHU I discovered that for two developed countries, it is surprising
            how differently Germany and the United States handle economics. Germany has a high income tax and does not
            have a minimum wage, while the US has a minimum wage, but has a relatively low income tax. Studying abroad
            in Germany and helped me to learn a different way an economy or business can function. Someday, I hope to
            apply this knowledge in developing economies.
