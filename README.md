# Responsive-Portfolio

This project is a fork of the first web-dev project I ever worked on.

This portfolio displays my projects. In many of my projects I rely heavily on the CSS library Bootstrap. I don't want to make it seem like I do not know how to write my own CSS, so in this portfolio I have not used any CSS libraries.
